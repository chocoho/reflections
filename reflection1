Reflections 13/09/01 - 13/09/07

This week involved mostly installing new programs into our computers. I've had experience with most of the programs installed, so there wasn't too much of an issue with installation for me. I struggled a little bit with accessing the IRC group chats because I have had no experience with that before, and Google was not very helpful. I messed around with some variations of the join command until I realized that Adium only needs a "#group_chat_name" input to join a chat room. Clearer instructions on that would have been helpful.

I did have a question about the specific set-ups for Virtual Box (such as how big should the hard drive be, did the professors want us to set up the virtual hard drive, etc), but this was eventually answered in class.

The final struggle I had was understanding the concept of forking and pull requests. I have been reading github sections on the respective topics to make the concepts clearer in my mind.
