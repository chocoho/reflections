Reflections 130922-130925

I was gone for my sister's wedding starting from Sept 120925, so my 
reflections will cover mostly just Tuesday's class. We were able to get 
resources for python learning (the safari textbooks in the UC lib system)
which I thought was helpful because I did not know about it before. 

In class, I learned a 
useful command for quitting a program while in the Virtual Box terminal 
(control z), and then you can still run the program in the backgroun (bg)!
I thank my tech lead for this useful tidbit.

I agree that having feedback about reflections would be nice. I am still
not 100% if my reflections have been submitted, so having a quick confirmation
either via bspace or github would be nice.

I agree that having a google calendar would be a good idea. 

This week involved guest lecturer speakers, and did wnot involve new 
installations. I did struggle some more this week dealing with ipython
in the Virtual Machine, but after talking to some classmates about it,
I believe everything has been sorted out.
