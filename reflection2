Reflections 13/09/08 - 13/09/13

Improvement Suggestions:
The class this week seemed more disorganized than last week because the lack of homework posts and in-class summaries. The professor did explain in class that it was because he was busier this week, but it would have been nice to have sent a quick announcement via space telling us about the delay.

Classroom praises:
This week we discussed how to improve the classroom dynamics as well as seeing what the strengths of the class were. I liked this because it established further than the instructors cared about creating an effective work environment and we were able to create a conversation between the instructors and the groups. 

Personal Challenges:
I realized that I did not submit my reflections homework in correctly last week. I realized that I should have gone to the IRC and asked my fellow classmates for help if I was confused on how to do this. 

Personal Improvements:
This week, I've begun a journal documenting what we've done in class and what I've been doing outside of class. This helps me look back at what we've done before in class more easily, and allows me to remember the questions that I've had. 

Questions:
I'm confused about what we are going to do with ipython, how to check if it works for us, and the purpose of all the other programs we have been downloading.
