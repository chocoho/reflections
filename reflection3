# Reflections 13/09/14 - 13/09/21

This week involved guest lecturer speakers, and did not involve new 
installations. I did struggle some more this week dealing with ipython
in the Virtual Machine, but after talking to some classmates about it,
I believe everything has been sorted out. 

All the other installations I had completed last week. I look forward to
using our installed programs this upcoming week!
